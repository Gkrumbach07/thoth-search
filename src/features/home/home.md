The home feature scopes for the landing page off the app. The core functionalities include searching for a
package and searching/building a Thoth Advise report.

### ðŸ“„ Pages
There is only one page but it can be split into two tabs: **package search** and **advise report search**.

The **package search** tab consists of a single search bar which invokes the `usePackageMetadata` hook.

The **advise report search** tab has two options in itself: searching for an already built advise report or building
an advise report. Searching redirects to the advise feature and building invokes the `usePostAdvise` hook
to start the Thoth Advise process server side.

### ðŸ“¡ API
**usePostAdivse** :: starts up an advise report build.
